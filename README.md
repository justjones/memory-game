Udacity project Memory Game

This memory game was created as a project for Udacity front end web development nanodegree.
The html and css files were proved by Udacity and minor changes were applied. 
To complete the project vanilla javascript was written and linked to the html file. the
app.js file as provided by Udacity included only a shuffle function. The students job was to finish the js file for user interaction and game behavior. some fonts in are dependant on Google fonts.  


How it works: The user is presented with 16 cards face down. Clicking a card will show the face, the card should remain face up until the user clicks another card. If the cards match both cards remain face up and the background color should change. if the cards do not match they will return to face down. 

The objective of this game is to find all the matches with the least amount of time and moves. 

When all the matches are found a modal popup displays the time, number of moves, and a star rating. 

The game includes a restart button. 

Some parts of may have been obtained from online resources in an attempt to learn about the process. sites such as sitepoint and videos from youTube.
